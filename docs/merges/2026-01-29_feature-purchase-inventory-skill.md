## How to Use

Invoke the skill in Claude Code:
```
/purchase-inventory
```

Then provide:
- Photos of receipts/LEGO sets (up to 10)
- Text description (e.g., "Bought 3x 75192 from eBay for £450 PayPal")
- Or both for best accuracy

The skill will guide you through missing fields and create the records on approval.

## Next Steps

1. Test the skill manually with real purchases
2. Monitor for any issues with Brickset/ASIN lookups
3. Consider adding more listing platforms if needed
